# README Generator

## Description

For your project, create a high-quality README to help your users on introducing the application to them. Include important features such as how to use the app, how to install it, contributers, how to contact you and links to their own GitHub.
A high-quality README leads to a more professional application and you can create that now utilizing a couple easy steps below. 

## Installation
1) git clone: Clone the Code from GitHub onto your local computer
2) Open in coding software of your choice
3) Open the CLI
4) npm install (should install inquirer)

## How to Use App
1) After installation, start CLI and run `node index.js`
2) Answer the questions in the prompts
3) Find your new proREADME.md in the created folder!!!
   
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.
